# TodoApp-PureJS
Hello everyone,

I've created a simple and minimalistic to-do list application using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. You can easily add your to-do tasks, and when you've completed a task, you can delete it by clicking the trash can icon.

This was a very basic exercise as part of my learning journey, and I hope you find it enjoyable and useful. If you had a good experience with it, I would greatly appreciate it if you could give it a star.

Thank you!
